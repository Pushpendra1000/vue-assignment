## Documentation

### Graph Design Scenarios

- The graph is implemented using the [`force-graph`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/force-graph) library.
- Currently, it uses static JSON data.
- A feature has been added to allow the creation of new nodes. Simply click on an existing node to open a modal with options to add either a `course` or a `module`. Once selected, the new node will be added as a branch or neighbor to the selected node.
